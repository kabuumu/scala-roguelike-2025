# Outdoor Area Expansion - Verification

## Changes Made

The outdoor area has been successfully expanded to encompass the entire dungeon. Here's what changed:

### Before
- Only the starting room (single room at `startPoint`) was treated as the outdoor area
- The starting room had grass tiles and tree perimeter
- Rest of the dungeon was indoor tiles

### After
- **Outdoor area now surrounds the entire dungeon** with 2 room-widths of padding on all sides
- The outdoor perimeter consists of:
  - **Outer boundary**: Impassable trees (forming a border around everything)
  - **Inner outdoor area**: Grass tiles (Grass1, Grass2, Grass3) with variety
- **All dungeon rooms remain inside** the outdoor area with their original indoor tiles
- **Starting room** still uses grass/dirt tiles as a transition point from outdoor to indoor

## Implementation Details

### File Modified: `src/main/scala/map/Dungeon.scala`

1. **Calculate dungeon bounds** - Find min/max room coordinates
2. **Create outdoor padding** - Add 2 room-widths of space around the dungeon
3. **Generate outdoor tiles**:
   - Outer perimeter (x/y at min/max) = Trees (impassable)
   - Inner outdoor area = Grass tiles with variety
4. **Combine maps** - Outdoor tiles + dungeon room tiles (rooms override outdoor)

## Test Results

All 6 tests in `OutdoorAreaTest` pass successfully:

1. ✅ Starting room is an outdoor area with grass tiles
2. ✅ Starting room is surrounded by trees
3. ✅ Trees are impassable (part of walls set)
4. ✅ No enemies spawn in outdoor area
5. ✅ Outdoor area uses different tile types than regular dungeon
6. ✅ **Outdoor area encompasses entire dungeon with grass and tree perimeter** (NEW)

### Example Output
```
Dungeon bounds: (0, 0) to (90, 90)
Outdoor bounds: (-20, -20) to (130, 130)
Found 5,832 grass tiles in outdoor area
Found 600 trees in outer perimeter
```

## Player Experience

Players now spawn in a grass-filled outdoor area and can see:
- Trees forming a natural boundary around the entire game world
- Grass transitioning to dungeon entrances
- The dungeon structure clearly defined within the outdoor environment
- A more cohesive and natural-feeling game world

## Benefits

1. **Better world coherence** - The dungeon feels like it's part of a larger outdoor environment
2. **Clear boundaries** - Tree perimeter provides visual and gameplay boundaries
3. **Atmospheric depth** - Outdoor → Indoor transition enhances immersion
4. **Scalable design** - Outdoor area automatically scales with dungeon size
