# Code Coverage Report

## Current Coverage: 54.1%

This document provides detailed code coverage metrics and technical analysis for the Scala Roguelike 2025 project. For build and testing instructions, see the main [README.md](README.md#-build--test).

## Overview

The project maintains **54.1% estimated code coverage** across 3,426 lines of main source code with 2,252 lines of test code, providing a test-to-source ratio of 0.66.

## Detailed Coverage Breakdown

| Area | Main Lines | Test Lines | Estimated Coverage | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **game/system** | 924 | 1,436 | ~100% | Combat, movement, equipment systems |
| **ui** | 209 | 316 | ~100% | User interface and input handling |
| **map** | 466 | 83 | ~53% | Dungeon generation algorithms |
| **game/entity** | 613 | 70 | ~34% | Entity component system |
| **util** | 91 | 0 | ~0% | Pathfinding and utilities |
| **indigoengine** | 640 | 0 | ~0% | Engine integration layer |

## Test Suite Breakdown

The project includes **128 tests** across **14 test suites**:

- **MovementSystemTest** (7 tests): Player movement and collision detection
- **GameControllerStoryTest** (6 tests): High-level game interactions
- **EntityTest** (10 tests): Component system functionality
- **InitiativeSystemTest** (2 tests): Turn-based combat timing
- **EquipmentSystemTest** (19 tests): Equipment and inventory mechanics
- **MapGeneratorTest** (23 tests): Dungeon generation with various configurations
- **Plus 8 additional suites**: Covering pathfinding, UI state management, combat systems, and more

## Coverage Analysis Tools

### Technical Limitations with ScalaJS

Standard JVM-based coverage tools have fundamental limitations with ScalaJS projects:

- **Scoverage**: Instruments JVM bytecode, but ScalaJS compiles to JavaScript
- **JaCoCo**: Requires JVM bytecode for instrumentation
- **Standard tools**: Most coverage frameworks assume JVM execution environment

### Custom Analysis Solution

This project uses a custom Python script (`scripts/analyze_coverage.py`) that provides reliable coverage estimates by:

- Analyzing source code structure and test file correspondence
- Using heuristic estimation based on test-to-source ratios
- Accounting for ScalaJS compilation differences
- Providing area-specific coverage breakdown

The script is integrated into CI/CD and provides the coverage metrics shown above.

## Coverage Goals and Improvement Areas

### Current Baseline: 54%

The minimum coverage threshold is set to **54%** based on current measured coverage to prevent regression.

### High-Priority Improvement Areas

1. **util package** (0% coverage):
   - Add tests for A* pathfinding algorithm implementation
   - Test line-of-sight calculation functions
   - Validate geometric utility functions

2. **indigoengine package** (0% coverage):
   - Add integration tests for game engine interactions
   - Test rendering pipeline integration
   - Validate input handling and event processing

3. **game/entity package** (34% coverage):
   - Expand component system test coverage
   - Test entity lifecycle management scenarios
   - Add integration tests for entity interactions

### Well-Covered Areas (Maintain Current Standards)

1. **game/system** (~100% coverage):
   - Comprehensive testing of combat mechanics
   - Movement system validation
   - Equipment system functionality

2. **ui** (~100% coverage):
   - Input handling verification
   - User interface state management
   - Controller logic testing

3. **map** (~53% coverage):
   - Good coverage of dungeon generation algorithms
   - Room placement and corridor generation testing

## Guidelines for Contributors

### Before Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Run coverage analysis**: Use `python3 scripts/analyze_coverage.py` to verify coverage
2. **Ensure new features include tests**: Especially for areas with low coverage
3. **Target improvement areas**: Focus on util, indigoengine, and game/entity packages
4. **Follow build workflow**: See [README.md Build & Test section](README.md#-build--test)

### For Code Reviewers

1. **Verify test inclusion**: New code should include appropriate tests
2. **Check coverage impact**: Ensure overall coverage doesn't decrease below 54%
3. **Focus on critical paths**: Prioritize testing for game-breaking functionality
4. **Review test quality**: Tests should cover edge cases and error conditions

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Custom Coverage Script Methodology

The `analyze_coverage.py` script uses several heuristics:

- **File structure analysis**: Maps test files to corresponding source files
- **Line counting**: Counts non-comment, non-empty lines in source and test files
- **Ratio calculation**: Estimates coverage based on test-to-source line ratios
- **Area categorization**: Groups files by package structure for detailed reporting

### Known Accuracy Limitations

- **Heuristic-based**: Estimates may not reflect actual runtime coverage
- **Line-based metric**: Doesn't account for branch or path coverage
- **Manual validation recommended**: Use alongside code review for accuracy

### Integration with CI/CD

- **Automated analysis**: Coverage script runs on every push and PR
- **Baseline enforcement**: CI fails if coverage drops below 54%
- **Reporting**: Coverage reports are generated and stored as artifacts

## Future Improvements

### Potential Technical Solutions

1. **Cross-compilation approach**: Maintain separate JVM build target for coverage collection
2. **Alternative tools**: Research emerging ScalaJS-compatible coverage frameworks  
3. **Enhanced analysis**: Improve custom script accuracy with AST parsing
4. **Runtime instrumentation**: Explore JavaScript-based coverage collection

### Monitoring and Process Improvements

1. **Regular coverage reviews**: Include coverage analysis in all PR reviews
2. **Quarterly improvement goals**: Set specific targets for low-coverage areas
3. **CI/CD enhancement**: Integrate coverage trending and historical analysis
4. **Documentation updates**: Keep coverage goals aligned with project growth
